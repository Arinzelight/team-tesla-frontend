ALL DEVELOPERS SHOULD TAKE NOTE.

1. PLEASE CLONE THE REPO AND ONLY WORK ON THE DEVELOPMENT BRANCH.PLEASE DON'T WORK ON THE MAIN BRANCH.
2. WHEN YOU ARE ABOUT TO START, ENSURE YOU MAKE AN INITIAL PULL REQUEST TO UPDATE THE CODE BASE LOCALLY ON YOUR SYSTEM FROM THE DEVELOPMENT BRANCH.
3. CREATE A SEPARATE BRANCH, THAT IS WHERE YOU SHOULD IMPLEMENT THE TASK ASSIGNED TO YOU.
4. BEFORE SUBMISSION, ENSURE TO ASSIGN ME(EKOMOBONG, MY GITHUB NAME IS: @ABUGINTHECODE) TO REVIEW YOUR CODE. ALSO TAKE A SCREEN SHOT TO SHOW THAT YOUR FEATURE/IMPLEMENTATION IS WORKING WELL. I WILL BE IN CHARGE OF MERGING CODE. PLEASE DON'T MERGE YOUR CODE UNTIL I HAVE REVIEWED IT.
5. I WILL BE RAISING ISSUES/TICKETS AND ASSIGNING THEM TO TEAM MEMBERS TO AS NEEDED.

THANK YOU GUYS! LET'S DO THIS!
