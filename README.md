# PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE STARTING DEVELOPMENT


1. Please ensure that you create a branch from the development branch, ALWAYS PULL FIRST, then start working. Please let us avoid git conflict errors. They are always a hassle to solve.
2. Any task that is assigned to you please ENSURE YOU ASSIGN ME TO REVIEW IT BEFORE YOU MERGE. DON'T MERGE YOUR CODE UNTIL I HAVE REVIEWD THAT EVERYTHING IS ALRIGHT.
3. We are working with only two branches MAIN AND DEVELOPMENT. Don't pull or make any changes to the main branch. Don't also make any direct changes to the development branch! Always create a seperate branch from the development branch.
